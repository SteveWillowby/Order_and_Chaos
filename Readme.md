# Order and Chaos

## About

This code is associated with the research paper (TODO: Title) currently on arXiv at (TODO: link).


## Installation

### Main Binary

The code for the main binary is all self-contained in this repository, so no outside libraries or packages should be necessary.

To compile, run:

`./nauty_traces_setup.sh`

and then run:

`./compile.sh`

That's it! The main program should be ready to run.


### Other Experiments

Much of the experimental code that uses the main binary is coded in Python.

Necessary Python packages are: (TODO: Fill in)

You can install these with the commands: (TODO: Fill in) 


## Running the Main Binary

The main binary is located at `executables/main`.

To see the command-line options, run `executables/main -h`
