Highschool network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the moreno_highschool network: This directed network contains friendships between boys in a small highschool in Illinois. Each boy was asked once in the fall of 1957 and the spring of 1958. This dataset aggregates the results from both dates. A node represents a boy and an edge between two boys shows that the left boy chose the right boy as a friend. The edge weights show how often that happened. As a boy could choose the same boy twice edge values from 1 to 2 are allowed.


More information about the network is provided here:

Files: 
    meta.moreno_highschool -- Metadata about the network 
    out.moreno_highschool -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.moreno_highschool are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
        Third column: edge weight
