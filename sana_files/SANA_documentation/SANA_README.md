# Noise-Alignments
Experiments with aligning "noise" to itself and to other graphs.

## Setup of SANA ("Simulated Annealing Network Aligner")

One option: Run `./setup.sh`

Alternatively, run the following commands (contained in `setup.sh`):

Run `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/waynebhayes/SANA/ --branch 0039f39`

Run `cd SANA; make` to compile SANA.
