Usage: ./sana [OPTION] [ARG(S)] [OPTION] [ARG(S)]...

Aligns the biological networks of two species.

Example: ./sana -g1 yeast -g2 human -ec 1 -t 20
Above example aligns yeast and human for a duration of 20 minutes, optimizing ec.

Note: Choosing a good objective function and a long enough run time are CRUCIAL to getting good results. Choose the wrong objective, and you'll get bad results no matter how much CPU time you spend. Choose too short a run time, and the result will be bad even with the best objective function.
SANA has literally dozens of choices for objective function; type "./sana -h objectives" for a complete list.
As a rule of thumb, you can try "-ec 1" for networks that you expect to have low similarity (eg due to missing edges), or "-s3 1" for networks that you suspect have high similarity. The shortest reasonable run time is probably 20 minutes, but we recommend experiment with up to 10 hours (600 minutes, so "-t 600") before trying shorter times.
