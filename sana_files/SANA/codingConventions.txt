In general, use camelCase (file names, class names, function names, variable names, ...)
Exceptions:
* Class names: start with uppercase
* Files containing classes: start with uppercase
* terminal arguments: start with "-" and include only lower case letters

Indentation is 4 spaces (tabs should not appear anywhere)
