"""
./ecounts does not return an edge if it is isolated
This program finds all isolated edges and adds them to the file output for
ecounts that is used for edge alignment

the n2dumps file lists all edges in the in the graph. In this file, at each row, it
lists a node and the number of edges it touches. If it only touches one other node, check
the remainder of that row. If that row is all 0's, then that node is excluded from the final
output of ./ecounts.

This program finds that excluded edges, then adds the edge to the output of ecounts with trailing 0's
for all the orbits

usage: python edge_counts_check.py dumps_file.ndump2 ecounts_file.ecounts network.gw
