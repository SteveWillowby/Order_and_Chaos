Before you start using resnik.py as a script, here are several things you must consider.

1) Annotation corpora currently are only accepted in gaf-2.0 format, listed here:
    http://geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-format-20
2) The first network, -g1, is the one that the second network, -g2, is aligned to.

3) The format for alignment is the first line of the sana.out file.
    - Currently working on supporting a multi-column alignment file 

4) This will NOT work with any of the networks currently, except human and yeast.
    - All other networks have the NCBI designation for genes, which are not 
      in the annotation corpora provided by the Gene Ontology Consortium listed here:
    http://geneontology.org/page/download-annotations
